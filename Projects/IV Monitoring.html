<p>	IV Monitoring System using Raspberry Pi Pico W.
    	The main objective of proposed system is to provide reliable, convenient, effortless and cost effective system for saline level monitoring. As the saline goes below the critical level, it is necessary to change the saline bottle. 
    	The buzzer starts ringing when the liquid goes below the critical level and automatically nurse will get the notification of warning.
    	The main sensor used in this project is Load  Cell which is a weight sensor and HX711 which is a Load Cell Amplifire.
