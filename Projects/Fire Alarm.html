<h1>Fire Alarm (With basic Components)</h1>
<p>>Project Includes very basic components like
    Thermistor, diode, Capacitor, Buzzer,LED etc.</p
<p>A Fire Alarm warns people when smoke, fire, carbon monoxide or other fire-related
    emergencies are detected. These alarms may be activated automatically from smoke detectors,
    and heat detectors or may also be activated via manual fire alarm activation devices such as
    manual call points or pull stations. Alarms can be either motorized bells or wall mountable
    sounders or horns. They can also be speaker strobes which sound an alarm, followed by a voice
    evacuation message which warns people inside the building not to use the elevators.
    Fire alarm sounders can be set to certain frequencies and different tones including low, medium
    and high, depending on the country and manufacturer of the device. Most fire alarm systems in
    Europe sound like a siren with alternating frequencies. Fire alarm electronic devices are known
    as horns in the United States and Canada, and can be either continuous or set to different codes.
    Fire alarm warning devices can also be set to different volume levels.</p>
    
    <h2>Working </h2>

    <p>
        We will now see the working of the simple Fire Alarm Circuit. First thing to know is that
       the main component in detecting the fire is the 10 K Thermistor. As we mentioned in the
       component description, the 10 K Thermistor used here is a NTC type Thermistor. If the
       temperature increases, the resistance of the Thermistor decreases.
       In case of fire, the temperature increases. This increase in temperature will reduce the resistance
       of the 10 K Thermistor. As the resistance decreases, the output of the voltage divider will
       increase. Since the output of the voltage divider is given to the nonâ€“ inverting input of the BC
       548, its value will become more than that of the inverting input. As a result, the output of the Op
       Amp becomes high and it activates the buzzer.</p>
