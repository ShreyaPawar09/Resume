<h1>Smart Glasses For Blind</h1>
<p>Smart Glasses For Blind is based on Arduino Uno .The
    main sensor used in this is the Ultrasonic sensor.</p>
    <p>There are multiple smart devices such as smart glasses,
        smartwatches, etc. available in the market. But all of them
        are built for us. There is a significant lack of technology to
        aid the physically challenged. We wanted to build
        something that is useful for visually challenged people. So
        we designed low-cost smart glass that can be used to help
        the visually impaired.
        This project uses a few ultrasonic distance sensors, an
        Arduino UNO, a buzzer, and vibration motor.
        The circuit used in this project is designed in the form of a
        spectacle, which can be worn by a visually impaired
        person. An ultrasonic sensor mounted on the glasses will
        detect the obstacle with the help of the Arduino and notify
        the user through headphones and vibration motors.</p>
        <h2>Working</h2>
        <p>
            This device includes a pair of glasses and an obstacle
            detection module fitted in it in the center, a processing unit,
            an output device i.e. a beeping component, and a power
            supply. The Obstacle detection module and the output device
            is connected to the processing unit. The power supply is used
            to supply power to the central processing unit. The obstacle
            detection module basically consists of an ultrasonic sensor,
            processing unit consist of an Arduino and the output unit
            consists of a buzzer and vibrating motor. The control unit
            controls the ultrasonic sensors and get the information of the
            obstacle present in front of the man and processes the
            information and sends the output through the buzzer
            accordingly. These Ultrasonic Smart Glasses for Blind people
            is a portable device, easy to use, light weight, user friendly
            and cheap in price. These glasses could easily guide the blind
            people and help them avoid obstacles.
            This works as in the ultrasonic sensor which is mounted
            on the head of the glasses, constantly keep on detecting
            the objects in front of them, if the object comes near than
            50 cm, the Arduino is programmed such that buzzer will
            give intermittent beeps as warning and if the object comes
            near than 30 cm it will give a long solid beep as warning.</p>
