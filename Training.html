    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>
    The Texas Instruments® TivaWare™ Peripheral Driver Library is a set ofdrivers
    for accessing the peripherals found on the Tiva™ family of ARM® Cortex™- M based
    microcontrollers. While they are not drivers in the pure operatingsystem sense(that is,
    they do not have a common interface and do not connect intoa global device driver
    infrastructure), they do provide a mechanism that makes it easy to use the device’s
    peripherals.</p>
    <p>For many applications, the drivers can be used as is. But in some cases, the drivers
    will have to be enhanced or rewritten in order to meet the functionality, memory, or
    processing requirements of the application. If so, the existing driver canbe used as a
    reference on how to operate the peripheral. The Driver Library includes drivers for all
    classes of Tiva microcontrollers.</p>

    <h2>ABOUT TM4C123G6PM</h2>
    <p>
        The TM4C123G LaunchPad Evaluation Kit is a low-cost evaluation platform for
        Arm Cortex-M4F based microcontrollers. Featuring a 80-MHz Arm Cortex-M4F CPU,
        256kB of flash, and 32kB of SRAM, the TM4C123GH6PM MCU provides integrated
        USB 2.0 support for USB Host/Device/OTG and two 12-bit ADC modules. The
        TM4C123GH6PM also includes a multitude of serial communication channels such as
        UART, SPI, I2C, and CAN. The design of the TM4C123G LaunchPad highlights the
        TM4C123GH6PM USB 2.0 device interface and additional device features suchas the
        hibernation and PWM modules.</p>
     <p>The EK-TM4C123GXL includes programmable user buttons and an RGB LED forcustom
        applications. The stackable headers provide the interface to connect BoosterPack™ plugin modules and make it easy and simple to expand the functionality of the TM4C123G
        LaunchPad through the Texas Instruments BoosterPack ecosystem. The TI-developed
        TivaWare SDK provides drivers for all peripherals and example code for dozens of
        applications for the TM4C123G LaunchPad.</p>
